# MAH-Code_Refractor_HW1
This is a repository for my (Malik Henry) first Homework Assignment on Refactoring Code. 

My motivation in creating this project was to modify existing code for the Horiseon website in such a way that would optimize search engine preference. Websites with cleaner, better organized code tend to have prefernce in the search engine algorithm, so the goal was to update the HTML file and style sheet to meet industry standards thus optimizing search engine performance. 

This project solved multiple problems while maxmimzing user-friendliness. By adding semantic HTML elements, the readability of both the HTML and CSS files matches the industry standard and gives clear indication of what function the code performs and the layout of the web browser. Most notably, non-smeantic <div> elements were replaced with more descriptive elements such as <nav>, <section>, <header>, and <footer> where appropriate. 

In this project, I learned the most efficient way to consolidate redundant code while improving browser performance and maintaining prior functioning of the site. For example, the search engine optimization link in the header of the page did not initially navigate to the proper part of the webpage. I fixed this by adding an id tag that made the link function properly.
